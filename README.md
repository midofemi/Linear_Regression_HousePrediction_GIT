# Linear_Regression_HousePrediction_GIT
The goal of this project was to build an end-to-end machine learning operational system that can predict median house value in a neighborhood based on several factors. A Flask application that loads the trained model into memory and exposes it via endpoint was built before deployment to a cloud-based platform called Heroku.
